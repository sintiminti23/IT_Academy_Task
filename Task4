Write a bash script to check:
    • Number of CPU Cores - ~$ nproc
      Output: 1
    • Disk space:
    Step One - ~$ df
    Step Two - $ df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }'
    Step Three - 
    #!/bin/sh
df -H | grep -vE '^Filesystem|tmpfs|cdrom' | awk '{ print $5 " " $1 }' | while read output;
do
  echo $output
  usep=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $1}' | cut -d'%' -f1  )
  partition=$(echo $output | awk '{ print $2 }' )
  if [ $usep -ge 90 ]; then
    echo "Running out of space \"$partition ($usep%)\" on $(hostname) as on $(date)" |
     mail -s "Alert: Almost out of disk space $usep%" you@somewhere.com
  fi
done
  • Size of RAM:
  $ free -g
  
  OUTPUT:
 
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:             24           0          23           0           1          23
Swap:             7           0           7
  
  •provide information about the last users which were login on the host - 
  $ last --fullnames
  
  •calculate the number of active python/perl process
  I was not able to do it 
  
  
  •create a cron job which will send a report information on email address
  first install mailutils , then configure it, however it was easier with the commant $ echo "testing message" | mail -s "message subject" username@example.com
